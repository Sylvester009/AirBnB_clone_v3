At the conclusion of this project, you are expected to possess the ability to thoroughly explain the following concepts to anyone without the need for consulting Google:

* HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): A standard markup language used for creating and structuring web pages, allowing the incorporation of text, images, multimedia, and other elements.

* Creating an HTML Page: An HTML page is constructed by writing HTML code within a text editor, specifying the structure and content of the web page using HTML elements (tags) and attributes.

* Markup Language: A markup language is a computer language that uses tags or annotations to define the structure and formatting of text, enabling the creation of documents that can be effectively displayed across different platforms and devices.

* DOM (Document Object Model): The DOM is a programming interface for web documents that represents the structure of a web page, allowing programs and scripts to access, manipulate, and modify its content, structure, and style.

* Element/Tag: HTML elements (or tags) are the building blocks of an HTML document, representing various components such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. They are typically enclosed within angle brackets (e.g., <h1>Heading</h1>).

* Attribute: Attributes are additional properties or values associated with HTML elements, providing further information or modifying the behavior or appearance of the element. They are typically written within the opening tag of an element (e.g., <a href="example.com">Link</a>).

* Browser Loading a Webpage: When a user requests a web page, the browser sends a request to the web server hosting the page. The server responds by sending the HTML file, along with any associated resources (CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.). The browser then parses the HTML, constructs the DOM, and renders the web page accordingly.

* CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation and styling of web pages, including layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects. It separates the content (HTML) from the presentation, allowing for more flexibility and consistency in web design.

* Adding Style to an Element: Styles can be applied to HTML elements using CSS by targeting the element's selector (e.g., element name, class, or ID) and specifying the desired styles within a CSS ruleset.

* Class: In HTML, a class is an attribute that allows you to group and target multiple elements for styling or scripting purposes. Elements with the same class name can share the same styles or behavior.

* Selector: In CSS, a selector is a pattern used to target and apply styles to specific HTML elements. Selectors can target elements based on their tag name, class, ID, attributes, or a combination of these.

* Computing CSS Specificity Value: The CSS specificity value is a calculation that determines which CSS rule takes precedence when multiple rules conflict. It is based on the specificity of the selectors used, with inline styles having the highest specificity, followed by ID selectors, class selectors, and finally element selectors.

* Box Properties in CSS: Box properties in CSS refer to the set of properties that control the layout and spacing of elements on a web page. These include properties such as margin, padding, border, and dimensions (width and height), which determine how elements are sized and positioned relative to other elements on the page.
